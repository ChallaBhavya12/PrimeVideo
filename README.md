I have built a basic prime video project in which it is sorted with categories and videos can be watched.

- When the **next button** is clicked in any of the sliders, the next movie items thumbnail in the corresponding moviesList should be displayed
- When the **previous button** is clicked in any of the sliders, the previous movie items thumbnail in the corresponding moviesList should be displayed <br/>
- When you click on the **thumbnail**, then the popup should be opened,
- And corresponding video should be displayed using **React player** component from `react-player`
